### Hi there! I'm Mendhie ðŸ‘‹

A Software Engineer committed to building, integrating, testing, and supporting android applications for mobile and tablet devices. Always ready to learn new tech stack and work with a goal-oriented team.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Docker containers to build and test android apps.

âš¡ Outside tech, I enjoy reading columns, watching Agadmator's Chess Channel on YouTube, and listening to good Afrobeat music.
